# Augmented Reality Chess

Augmented Reality Game featuring a chess board that you can *physically* interact with.

The location of all the pieces are streamed online so multiple players can view and interact with the same board simultaneously.

Interactions require a marked pointer (basically just a cheap piece of cardboard with a printout).

It's like playing a real game of chess with your friends from anywhere!

This same engine can support any type of board game.
